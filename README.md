# VACŌ - PROJECT TEMPLATE FRAMEWORK
Vacō is a project template framework created for the purpose of unifying and streamlining my project information and data. Naming of the template comes from Latin word 'vacō' which translates into 'I am void'. 

Fill the template structure with your own meaning, don't hesitate to make it yours. Change the sections, template's structure if a need arises to modify it. Templates are supposed to work for you as fluid outlines not as rigid boxes - you know what you need best for a certain project.

### Usage
```
// Instructions
Vacō works best in conjunction with GitHub Desktop to make the setup process as quick as possible. 

1. Fork this repo.
2. Alternatively just clone it directly via GitHub Desktop/other means.
3. Pull it.
4. Delete README.md
5. Adjust the TEMPLATE.md structure and content to your project and rename it to README.md.
6. Use included .afdesign or .psd gallery design templates for imagery (banner, dual, triple, quad gallery formats included).
7. Change the asset_category folders to types appropriate for your project (ex. audio, visual, research).
8. Replace placeholder.png files with your own assets (if none are present yet just leave the original files for now).
9. Subdivide the folder structure if necessary.
