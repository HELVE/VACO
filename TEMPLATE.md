# VACŌ - PROJECT TEMPLATE FRAMEWORK
Vacō is a project template framework created for the purpose of unifying and streamlining my project information and data. Naming of the template comes from Latin word 'vacō' which translates into 'I am void'. 

Fill the template structure with your own meaning, don't hesitate to make it yours. Change the sections, template's structure if a need arises to modify it. Templates are supposed to work for you as fluid outlines not as rigid boxes - you know what you need best for a certain project.

### Installation and Usage (gifs?)
```
Vacō works best in conjunction with GitHub Desktop to make the setup process as quick as possible. 

1. Fork this repo or clone it via GitHub Desktop/other means.
2. Pull it and delete README.md.
3. Adjust TEMPLATE.md structure/content to your project, rename it README.md.
4. Use .afdesign/.psd gallery design templates for custom images (banner, dual, triple, quad formats included).
5. Export your custom image files to readme_visuals.
6. Change asset_category folders to appropriate types for your project (ex. audio, visual, research).
7. Replace placeholder.png files with your assets (if none present leave the original files).
8. Subdivide the folder structure if necessary.
```

Project name: Your project’s name is the first thing people will see upon scrolling down to your README, and is included upon creation of your README file.

Description: A description of your project follows. A good description is clear, short, and to the point. Describe the importance of your project, and what it does.

Table of Contents: Optionally, include a table of contents in order to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs.

Installation: Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

Usage: The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

Contributing: Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for setting guidelines for repository contributors.

Credits: Include a section for credits in order to highlight and link to the authors of your project.

License: Finally, include a section for the license of your project. For more information on choosing a license, check out GitHub’s licensing guide!
